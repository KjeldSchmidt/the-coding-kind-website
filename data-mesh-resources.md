**Data Mesh Accelerate Workshop**  
A workshop outline by Paulo Caroli and Steve Upton, based on Ammara Gafoor's workshops

When an organisation actually wants to commit to a Data Mesh strategy, there are
important decisions to be made and goals to be aligned. A core tenant of the
Data Mesh principles is the empowerment of teams, but the right environment 
needs to be created, and there still needs to be a common understanding of the 
measures of success.

Based on over twenty successful Data Mesh workshops, this article gives you the
tools to run an internal workshop which marks the transition of your
organisation going from "talking about Data Mesh" to "Committing to Data Mesh".

**Data Mesh Principles**  
By Zhamak Dehghani

In this foundational text, Zhamak Dehghani refines and encapsulates the core
principles of the Data Mesh approach (though she
[coined the term a year before](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html)).

Understanding the core fundamentals is essential to understand how to adapt to
individual circumstances without falling victim to hype-based obfuscation or the
"same thing, different name" fallacy, such as the recent antipattern of having
distinct "DevOps Teams" and "Development Teams".

**Surfacing reliability SLIs and SLOs can boost adoption**  
With founder and CEO of Monte Carlo, Barr Moses

> Have you ever come across an internal data product and side-eyed it like it’s
> your kid’s prom date? While it seems like it fits the requirements, you don’t
> quite trust it — who knows where the data in this shifty table has been. 
> Will it be reliable and safe even after you turn your focus elsewhere? 
> Will the schema stay true?

A core principle of Data Mesh is the _trustworthiness_ of a data product. 
This is not quite the same as being available, reliable and correct - the major
distinction making a product _trustworthy_ is that these quality attributes are
tracked and communicated. Using a data source that _guarantees_ 90% correctness 
is often perfectly acceptable, but using one that _has_ 99.9% correctness, but 
makes no claims that it will stay that way might not be okay.

Data Mesh, teams are enabled to create unique and valuable Data Products instead
