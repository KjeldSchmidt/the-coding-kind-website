### Rapid User Prototyping

We take pride in getting usable software in front of real people as quickly as
possible. This means validating core functionality early, adapting based on real
feedback, and reducing the risk of investing in the wrong thing. If you're
exploring a new product, pitching 
<span class="right icon alt giant fa-solid fa-code-compare"><span class="label">Iteration Icon</span></span>
to stakeholders, or just need to see something tangible before committing fully -
whether it’s a proof of concept, an MVP, or something in between, we can help 
you move from idea to execution with speed and clarity.

**This is a great fit if:**{: .list-heading}
- you have existing users, either customers or internal.
- there are new processes coming up soon and there is no current software support for them.
- you have an idea for a new feature, but it requires a proof of concept.
- a current tool is seen as a "necessary evil", for doing an important task poorly.

**You can expect:**{: .list-heading}
- greatly improved understanding of the problem space.
- working software that demonstrates a solution for the problem.
- a clear path to a decision: abandon the idea, expand it into a larger project,
  or adopt the provided solution as-is?

### Delivery Enablement

Building software is one thing; delivering it reliably is another. Over and over,
we've seen capable software developers held back by slow processes and error-prone
workflows. We have extensive experience in dragging the cart out of the mud and 
putting it back on the road,
<span class="left icon alt giant fa-solid fa-map-location-dot"><span class="label">speed icon</span></span>
by enabling developer teams to find processes that work in their context.

We work with your team to remove bottlenecks, increase automation, and create a
delivery pipeline that’s smooth, predictable, and resilient. Through improving
CI/CD, refining testing strategies and creating stable and repeatable environments,
we can help you focus on building great software without release anxiety.

**This is a great fit if:**{: .list-heading}
- there is an existing team of developers looking to deliver faster, more frequently and with fewer errors.
- programming and operations are done by different teams, and you want to change this.
- there is a consistent struggle to onboard new team members.
- long wait times to see that changes succeeded are common.
- deployments depend on the knowledge and expertise of a single team member.

**You can expect:**{: .list-heading}
- code changes can go live in minutes instead of days or weeks.
- introducing new errors will become rarer, and their impact severely reduced.
- deploying will become a business choice instead of a technical one.

### Software Development

Sometimes, you just need important software to be built well. We bring experience,
attention to detail, and a pragmatic approach to solving problems with code. 
Whether it’s a greenfield project, fixing bugs in legacy systems, 
<span class="right icon alt giant fa-solid fa-hexagon-nodes"><span class="label">speed icon</span></span>
or filling gaps on your team, we focus on writing maintainable,
effective software that fits your needs.

Good software isn’t just about making things work—it’s about making them work in
a way that’s maintainable. We care about making important trade-offs that keep
projects moving forward without unnecessary complexity. Whether you need a small,
well-scoped feature or a large, multi-phase project, we approach development with
a mix of craftsmanship and practicality. Our goal is to build software that serves
your needs in the moment and remains adaptable for whatever comes next.

**This is a great fit if:**{: .list-heading}
- there is greater delivery pressure than your team can currently fulfill, or you have no permanent development teams.
- you need expertise in cloud operations, backend software across numeroud languages, infrastructure management, database design (and more).
- legacy software needs a mysterious bug fixed.
- you need someone who can communicate both from a business perspective and from a highly technical one.

**You can expect:**{: .list-heading}
- rock-solid, useable and deployable software.
- expertise across a wide range of technical topics.
- consulting on effective ways to turn requirements into code.

### Unique and Creative Electronics

Some projects are meant to inspire and awe through delightful display pieces or 
unique physical interactions. Opening a hidden door in an escape room when the 
right melody is played on a piano?
Change a museum display based on whether people are looking directly at it or not? 
Light up the company logo,
<span class="right icon alt giant fa-solid fa-hexagon-nodes"><span class="label">speed icon</span></span>
carved from fine walnut, as people walk by? We're excited to help.

**This is a great fit if:**{: .list-heading}
- you have a creative idea for unique physical interactions.
- off-the-shelf industrial automations can't cover your needs efficiently.
- electronics need to be hidden or invisible.

**You can expect:**{: .list-heading}
- bespoke solutions, fitting technology to your exact creative vision.
- strong collaboration to achieve cost-effective solutions.
- to speak the language of vision and intent, without having to overthink the tech yourself.
