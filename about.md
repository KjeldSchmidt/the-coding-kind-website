### The Coding Kind – Striving for Human-Centric Software Development

Our company was build on the trust and partnership of years of collaboration 
between Kjeld Schmidt and Jan Plewa – both in and out of programming projects. 
We live by the principle that two pairs of eyes catch mistakes before they happen.
We deliver high-quality consulting and well-crafted software with the agility 
to adapt to change. If that’s what you are looking for, let’s talk.

### Jan Plewa - Web Developer and Complexity Translator

Jan is a Web- and Application Developer, graduate from Le Wagon and long-time 
Padawan of Kjeld. He seeks out high-paced developing environments with tight 
deadlines, from [Game Jams](https://itch.io/jam/pirate15/rate/2849539) to rapid
prototyping. His interests lie in database design and code architecture - 
currently at least. Jan enjoys throwing himself at new technologies and 
scientific topics, able to quickly make sense of abstract complexity.

He has a background in teaching both youth and adults, and takes care no one on
a team is left behind. He is passionate about communication and enjoys people
and technology challenges alike.

Jan is a top-tier dungeon master, as far as I know, and will persuade you to
join a gamenight given the slightest opportunity. He likes red but is open to
other colors too.
