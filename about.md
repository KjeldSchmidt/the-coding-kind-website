### **Jan Plewa** - Web Developer and Complexity Translator

Jan is a Web- and Application Developer, graduate from Le Wagon and long-time Padawan of Kjeld. He seeks out high-paced developing environments with tight deadlines, from [Game Jams](https://itch.io/jam/pirate15/rate/2849539) to rapid prototyping. His interests lie in database design and code architecture - currently at least. Jan enjoys throwing himself at new technologies and scientific topics, able to quickly make sense of abstract complexity.

He has a background in teaching both youth and adults, and takes care no one on a team is left behind. He is passionate about communication and enjoys people and technology challenges alike.

Jan is a top-tier dungeon master, as far as I know, and will persuade you to join a gamenight given the slightest opportunity. He likes red but is open to other colors too.
