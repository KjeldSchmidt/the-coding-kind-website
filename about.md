### The Coding Kind – Striving for Human-Centric Software Development

Our company was build on the trust and partnership of years of collaboration 
between Kjeld Schmidt and Jan Plewa – both in and out of programming projects. 
We live by the principle that two pairs of eyes catch mistakes before they happen.
We deliver high-quality consulting and well-crafted software with the agility 
to adapt to change. If that’s what you are looking for, let’s talk.

### Kjeld Schmidt - Automation Advocate and Swiss Army Knife of Development

Kjeld is a Software Developer advocating for human-driven development, open 
platforms and rapid experimentation. He has a keen mind for simplicity and essentials, 
which has paid off when he worked in diverse fields, from large Augmented Reality 
art exhibitions to cryptographically secure automotive firmware delivery.

He has spent four years at [Thoughtworks](www.thoughtworks.com), 
has spoken at [XConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4tBLzQlRGU) and can
frequently be found at [SoCraTes Conferences](https://www.socrates-conference.de/home)
around Europe.

Always happy to discuss the philosophies of building both teams and software, 
he is a strong believer in empowering teams and supporting them in finding their
ideal ways of working, and insists that agile is an adjective, not a noun.

Outside of work, he hikes, bikes, climbs and builds home automation from the 
ground up, with naught but a soldering iron and an army of microcontrollers.
No voice assistance allowed.

### Jan Plewa - Web Developer and Complexity Translator

Jan is a Web- and Application Developer, graduate from Le Wagon and long-time 
Padawan of Kjeld. He seeks out high-paced developing environments with tight 
deadlines, from [Game Jams](https://itch.io/jam/pirate15/rate/2849539) to rapid
prototyping. His interests lie in database design and code architecture - 
currently at least. Jan enjoys throwing himself at new technologies and 
scientific topics, able to quickly make sense of abstract complexity.

He has a background in teaching both youth and adults, and takes care no one on
a team is left behind. He is passionate about communication and enjoys people
and technology challenges alike.

Jan is a top-tier dungeon master, as far as I know, and will persuade you to
join a gamenight given the slightest opportunity. He likes red but is open to
other colors too.
