### **Jan Plewa** - Cool Person

Jan is a very cool dude who knows a lot about many things and has smart opinions.
He is interested in relevant societal topics and is often mad about intellectual 
property. His general vibe is pretty strong and we do all like him a lot.

He is a top-tier dungeon master, as far as I know, and will outplay you in
sixty different boardgames with ease. He likes red but is open to other colors too.
