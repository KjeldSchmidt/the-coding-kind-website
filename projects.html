		<h3 id="cryptography-platform--automotive-manufacturer">Cryptography Platform @ Automotive Manufacturer*</h3>

<p>This project saw the design and development of a service-oriented cryptographic middleware platform, which served dozens of internal development teams in order to guarantee that cryptographic operations are performed correctly, consistently, and compliant with regulatory and auditing requirements. High importance was placed on the long-term maintenance of a constantly growing project, scaling from a small group of tight-knit developers to multiple teams across five countries.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: Built on Azure with a focus on serverless architecture, with infrastructure managed and deployed via Terraform. Web applications written in Python and Java, frontends created in React. CosmosDB was used as the main database, and OpenTelemetry was used for distributed observability.</p>

<h3 id="after-alife-ahead-pierre-huyghe">After ALife Ahead (Pierre Huyghe)</h3>

<p>In this art exhibition, Kjeld supported the development and deployment of a network of heterogeneous devices with sensors and actuators to feed real-world data of a changing landscape into an Augemented Reality App to be used inside of the exhibition. After the initial development, he acted as the sole caretaker for the hard- and software that was physically deployed into a natural environment. Additional support for reworking  parts of this exhibition at other exhibitions was provided in 2021 and 2024.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: A group of Raspberry Piâ€™s, Arduinos, Windows Microcomputers and Mac Minis was connected through a custom message exchange protocol to measure and control a variety of factors around the exhibition. The devices were mostly programmed in Python, with some cases requiring additional automations in AppleScript, Autohotkey and Bash, or using other protocols, such as DMX or BLE positioning.</p>

<h3 id="world-wide-wishlist-browser-extension">World Wide Wishlist, Browser Extension</h3>

<p>Driven by his dissatisfaction with the private options and a desire for one unified wishlist capable of handling any webstore, Jan set out to improve on wishlists for online shopping. Starting with no experience in extension development, he created an chrome extension that can be used to save, organize and share products from almost every store on the internet, while retaining privacy and control over personal data.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: Based on Javascript with heavy involvement of the Chrome Extension API. Effective frontend styling achieved with Sass and Bulma. Pupeteer was used for integration tests with the Extension API.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="data-mesh-platform--ebike-manufacturer">Data Mesh Platform @ eBike Manufacturer*</h3>

<p>Kjeld acted as an Automation Engineer and expert for Terraform and Python during the creation of a Data Mesh platform for various internal teams, from assembly line monitoring to end user route recommendations. The Data Mesh platform enabled internal development teams to own their data analytics, which increased data literacy and the ability to gain valuable insights through domain expertise, while removing the dependency on dedicated data teams.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: The Data Mesh Platform, including data security management was built on Azure via Terraform, with additional automations provided via Python. Data Products themselves were built to run on Databricks, with template repositories and helper libraries written in Python.</p>
